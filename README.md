# My website (again, again, again...)

It's just a big list this time. One page with collapsible elements.

In fact it could be multiple pages, but I'll start with an index only.

## Format

- Pretty much just a markdown list
- Each line is a new list element.
- It must be preceded by a '-'
- Indentation level (in tabs) indicates depth in the list
- Elements starting with '@' are collapsible, and collapsed by default
