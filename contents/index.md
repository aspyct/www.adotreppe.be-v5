- My name is Antoine d'Otreppe, I am a...
	- @ Software Engineer
		- Proven track record in dev & ops, with a strong interest in security
		- Started programming early in 2001, and professionally in 2011.
		- Now progressing to a team lead / architect role.
		- Yes, this is a homemade website
			- I wanted something simple
			- So I made a big list
			- I find it's an easy way for me to structure knowledge.
			- Don't have much time, but want to document stuff for later
			- So that's a good way to do it.
	- @ Photographer
		- I used to be a part-time professional photographer.
		- I have now stopped doing it professionally.
			- It's a great art and hobby, but not a great job (for me, at least.)
		- I continue to enjoy the process for myself.
	- @ Horseman
		- I have a Spanish horse, he's the best!
		- @ Horse Training
			- Always be kind and listen to your horse
			- Have consistent requirements
			- Anytime you interact with a horse, you are training that horse.
			- Horses don't "make fun of you", they are just trying to say something.
			- Observe how horses communicate between themselves
				- Just go sit in that pasture and enjoy life. Isn't that why you're here anyway?
			- Control your energy
				- Are you in a good mood?
					- Sometimes it's better to do nothing if you're not in the right mindset.
				- Are you calm enough for a quiet moment?
				- Are you energetic enough for a sporty moment?
			- Two ways to reinforce behavior
				- Positive reinforcement: "Good job! Have a carrot!"
					- Have a clear "good job" sign
						- Some use a clicker
						- I use a specific tongue noise
						- Be consistent. If you do the sign, give a treat.
					- Bring the treat to the horse, not the opposite
						- Otherwise over time your horse will rip the treat off of your hand (or pocket...)
					- Between horses, they also have positive reinforcement, for example when they groom
				- Negative reinforcement: "I'll stop asking when you comply."
					- Use 4 "pressure phases"
						- Give your horse an opportunity to react to low pressure before you increase pressure
						- If you do it right, over time he will react earlier
						- "increase pressure" does not mean "get upset"
							- You should be in control of your energy at all time
					- Between horses, they also have negative reinforcement with phases:
						- 1. Move, take space
						- 2. Pin ears
						- 3. Bite
						- 4. Kick
				- You should use both methods
			- Desensitization must be done right
				- Teach your horse to choose to be courageous
				- You horse must have the opportunity to escape
					- Loose rope or liberty
				- Wave the scary object far away first
					- Horse must be relaxed 9 out of 10 times before you move closer
					- The 10th time, you win if he moves his head but not his feet
						- Remember: loose rope or liberty. He must be free to move.
					- If you won, get closer
					- If you didn't, take a step back and repeat.
				- Otherwise you're just teaching him to give up and close himself
					- Do that and one day he'll send you to the moon.
				- You can also teach your horse to touch something on command
					- Carrots!
					- Fun exercise when you come across scary things
			- Ground work is important and fun!
				- Whoever controls the other's feet wins.
				- Try liberty work sometime.
				- Challenge your horse's mind as much as his body
			- Learn about biomechanics
				- Don't rollkur, it's just demonstrably stupid.
		- @ Horse Health
			- ! Important Note: I am not a vet. Information that you see here is my collected knowledge, and it may be wrong.
			- @ Superficial skin wounds
				- Often happens when horses fight in the pasture
					- Lack of food?
					- Pecking order unclear?
				- Usually without long term consequences
				- Treatment
					- Clean gently with water
					- Disinfect with iodine (iso-betadine jaune)
					- Protect the wound against dirt and flies
						- I use "Baume de Warendorf"
						- or Furacine when it could get infected
						- other people use honey
			- @ Laminitis, aka "fourbure" in French
				- Inflammation of the inside of the hoof
				- Quite common and super dangerous
				- Can be triggered by
					- too much sugar in the grass (most common)
					- way too much work
					- Equine Metabolic Syndrome (~= diabetes in humans)
				- Symptoms
					- Hoof is warm to the touch
						- I'm not sure how warm. My horse sometimes has one hoof a little warm, but it doesn't last more than a day.
					- Horse shows signs of lameness
					- Hearth pulsations can be felt in the blood vessels at the fetlock ("boulet")
				- Treatment
					- Call your vet.
					- Reduce sugary food intake
						- Let hay soak in water before serving (~2h max)
						- Limit access to grass
							- In particular short grass, as it contains a lot of sugar.
					- Be patient, it takes a long time to heal properly.
				- If it's not treated properly
					- The third phalange of that foot can go through the hoof
					- It's basically game over by then.
			- @ Colics
				- Something is not working right in your horse's digestive system
				- Symptoms
					- Horse will appear generally unwell
					- Lowered interest in food
					- He looks, kicks or bites at his belly
					- He lies down and rolls a lot
						- Hey, sometimes he's just trying to sleep or have a good roll.
						- If he's only trying to lie down and roll without the other symptoms, you're probably good.
					- Sweating, heavy breathing
				- Treatment
					- Call your vet RIGHT NOW.
					- Try and get the horse to move
						- Walking is a good start
						- Trotting is good, but don't force it
						- Don't let your horse lie down.
					- Discuss the causes of the colic with your vet
